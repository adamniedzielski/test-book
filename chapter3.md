Print information about command-line arguments to stdout, then exit. This option is intended primarily for use in wrapper scripts. The first line of output contains the name of the output file specified with the -o option, or - (for stdout) if no output file was specified. The remaining lines contain the command-line arguments, one per line, in the order they appear. These do not include regular pandoc options and their arguments, but do include any options appearing after a -- separator at the end of the line.

There's no voting, per se. From what I've seen, feature requests may be left open for a while to give folks time to mull them over, discuss, and possibly create patches. Of course, it's easy to add features but difficult to remove them (once folks are using them).
